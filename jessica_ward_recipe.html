    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Frybread is a circular piece of dough that is cooked through frying. </p>

    <p> Frybread was invented as a result of Natives being put on reservations. Taken away from their indigenous food sources, Natives depended on the space rations,largely  consinsting of flour and oil, given to them by the government.</p>

    <p> Today, frybread is an important part of pan-Native American culture and is often the food of choice for large gatherings. It is often eaten as a desert with jam, powered sugar, or honey, or as a savory main course, called an 'Indian Taco'</p>
